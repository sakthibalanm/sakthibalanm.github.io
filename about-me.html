<h2>About Me</h2> 
              
          <p>After my doctorate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Madras in 2004, I worked as a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Computer Science, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada until 2008. Then I worked in various capacities in Infosys Limited, Electronics City, Bangalore for seven years until May 2015. </p>

<p>I am also a trained Carnatic vocal musician. I have got training under Palghat Shri K V Narayanaswamy and Shri T K Subramaniam for more than 15 years. I did my arangetram in 1995 and have performed in various places in and around Tirunelveli. I have also performed in Tiruvayuru Thyagaraja Aradhana in 1990.
</p>
              
<p>I am avid reader of books especially on philosophy, brain, mind, thinking, cognition, emotion, abstraction, and related stuffs. I blog <a href="http://intellectualnausea.wordpress.com"> here</a> and <a href="http://logofmymind.blogspot.com"> here</a> that include rants from all topics. Some of my favorite authors are M. Minsky, N. Frijda, V. S. Ramachandran, Steven Pinker, Douglas Hofstadter</p>

<p>My present research interest is in Social media analytics where I work in both structural and qualitative analysis. </p>
