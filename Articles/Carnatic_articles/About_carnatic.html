I am a great lover of Indian classical music. There are two different
styles in India; Hindustani and Carnatic. Hindustani is&nbsp; more
prevalent in northern part of India and Carnatic in southern part of
India. <br>
<br>
In this page I shall try to write very informally about carnatic music.
After the description of carnatic music I shall write about raga
lakshanas of some carnatic ragas. I shall be updating it raga lakshana
page periodically.<br>
<br>
What is carnatic music? I shall describe it in my own way....<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify;">I always relate our music to computer
science. We have at the top level the so called high level languages
(java, C, C++) next comes the level -- machine language (i.e., assembly
language). Eventhough we use C instruction when it goes to the system
it goes as assembly language isntruction and then these instructions
are further downed to bits 1 and 0 which is nothing but voltage or no
voltage. These most of you know in this modern world. Just have this in
mind when you read the following:<br>
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify;">In Carnatic music we have keerthanas
alias krithis which we sing/hear in concerts. These are just lyrics
tuned into some raga and thala. Just see that as a song with a tune and
a rhythm as of now. Forget the raga and thala for the time being. When
a krithi is sung with a tune (compare this with high level language) it
is basically structured on some swaras infact all the sounds in the
universe can be captured by these sapta swara. These swara are in
anology with the assembly language. These swara are nohting but the
frequency with which we sing. There are basically seven swaras "sa, ri,
ga, ma, pa, da, ni" These swaras are in increasing order of the
frequency. Hence even if we sing a tune it is based on some swaras. But
the swara is just a skeletal structure we have to give bhavam, brigha,
gamukam, softness, hardness everyhting to these swaras. Hence there is
a subtle difference in the comparisons here with computer science where
there is one-one relation between the high level language and the
assmebly language. But anyway to understand we can take this analogy.<br>
</div>
<br>
Hence whatever tunes we sing, its skeletal is swara, i.e.,<br>
sapta swaras. As said earlier these saptaswaras are nothing but some
sound frequency; this<br>
is in analogy with the bits 0 and 1 for computer science. what frequency<br>
we take for the swara "sa" acts as the shruthi, i.e. the base/reference
point for our music.<br>
Now these swaras which act as a skeleton for tunes come as a pattern.<br>
According to the pattern and according to what frequencies of the swaras<br>
we take, we get the raga. There is much more than this. Before going to<br>
that we have to note that once we take the swara sa as some frequency
which
<script><!--
D(["mb","acts as shruthi that si the basis of our music scale the other swaras have<br />to get the frequencies which are always at equidistance from the basic<br />swara sa. for example whatever frequency we take for sa, ri, ga etc...the<br />frequency(ri)-frequency(sa), the frequency(ga)-frequency(sa) ..........has<br />to be constant. Now ri can take 2 frequencies with respect to likewise ga<br />can take 2, ma 2, da 2, ni 2. So we have saptha swara giving rise to 12<br />swaras. Now we can have allpermutations of combinations fo these 12 swara<br />but satisifying some conditions: the pattern of the swara<br />(arohana-avarohana) should adhere to these,<br />1. the arohana should start with sa and end with maelsthayae (high pitch)<br />sa<br />2. avarohana the other way of arohana<br />according to what swaras and the pattern these arohana and avarohana takes<br />we have the raga. for example take mohanam<br />arohana: sa ri2 ga2 pa da2 sa(high pitch)<br />avarohana sa(high pitch) da2 pa ga2 ri 2 sa<br />But arohana-avarohana itslef does not constitute the raga there are things<br />like how u give empazise to some swaras, gamakam to swaras, bhavam to<br />swaras these also consitutute a raga.<br /><br />Now we come to the rhythm part. there are so many beats, like 8 beats<br />tala(adi tala), 10 beats tala (jamba thala) for each beat we can count the<br />number of swara we sing. normally we have 4 swaras for each beat. so if a<br />krithi is set to adi tala in one cycle it has 8*4\u003d32 swaras. for each cyle<br />of tala we say one avarthanam has finsihed. so I think we are little clear<br />abt the tala of the song and the raga of the song.<br /><br />Now we take up the manodharma aspects. manodharma is extempore singing in<br />stage, i.e., without any pre-preparation. there are four ways of doing<br />this<br />1. raga alpana<br />2. kalpanaswaram<br />3. niraval<br />4. thanam<br />there is one more - ragam thanam pallavi which is basically based on the<br />aspects.<br /><br />raga alapana: there is no lyrics here. artists use<br />",1]

acts as shruthi that si the basis of our music scale the other swaras
have<br>
to get the frequencies which are always at equidistance from the basic<br>
swara sa. for example whatever frequency we take for sa, ri, ga
etc...the<br>
frequency(ri)-frequency(sa), the frequency(ga)-frequency(sa)
..........has<br>
to be constant. Now ri can take 2 frequencies with respect to likewise
ga<br>
can take 2, ma 2, da 2, ni 2. So we have saptha swara giving rise to 12<br>
swaras. Now we can have allpermutations of combinations fo these 12
swara<br>
but satisifying some conditions: the pattern of the swara<br>
(arohana-avarohana) should adhere to these,<br>
1. the arohana should start with sa and end with maelsthayae (high
pitch)<br>
sa<br>
2. avarohana the other way of arohana<br>
according to what swaras and the pattern these arohana and avarohana
takes<br>
we have the raga. for example take mohanam<br>
arohana: sa ri2 ga2 pa da2 sa(high pitch)<br>
avarohana sa(high pitch) da2 pa ga2 ri 2 sa<br>
But arohana-avarohana itslef does not constitute the raga there are
things<br>
like how u give empazise to some swaras, gamakam to swaras, bhavam to<br>
swaras these also consitutute a raga.<br>
<br>
Now we come to the rhythm part. there are so many beats, like 8 beats<br>
tala(adi tala), 10 beats tala (jamba thala) for each beat we can count
the<br>
number of swara we sing. normally we have 4 swaras for each beat. so if
a<br>
krithi is set to adi tala in one cycle it has 8*4=32 swaras. for each
cyle<br>
of tala we say one avarthanam has finsihed. so I think we are little
clear<br>
abt the tala of the song and the raga of the song.<br>
<br>
Now we take up the manodharma aspects. manodharma is extempore singing
in<br>
stage, i.e., without any pre-preparation. there are four ways of doing<br>
this<br>
1. raga alpana<br>
2. kalpanaswaram<br>
3. niraval<br>
4. thanam<br>
there is one more - ragam thanam pallavi which is basically based on the<br>
aspects.<br>
<br>
raga alapana: there is no lyrics here. artists use

<div style="text-align: justify;" id="mb_0"><wbr>.riiii......ma...any
sound which is quite<br>
bearable to hear. but this has the underlining swaras no that will be<br>
having some pattern which consitututes the raga. This is called raga<br>
lapana. there is no rhythm for this. this is done before singing a<br>
krithi/pallavi<br>
<br>
kalpana swara: after singing a krithi singer can take up a single line<br>
from the song which he sung and sing kalpana swaras based on the raga of<br>
the song which is ended by sining that line. so each time he sings a
swara<br>
it is ended by singing that line. these swara pattern should adhere to
the<br>
raga structure. and there is more here...there is rhythm also here so<br>
the singer has to take note in which beat of the tala the line starts so<br>
his swara has to end each time at the same posotion fo the beat so that
he<br>
can sing that line from that beat.<br>
<br>
niraval: artist can take up a single line of the song and sing in all<br>
kinds of pattens but strictly following the raga pattern and the rhythm
of<br>
the song. this is usually sung before kalpanaswara<br>
<br>
thanam: this is usually sung before pallavi after singing the raga<br>
alapana. sually the words like thanam....and all its derived words
(i.e.,<br>
prefixes and suffix) comes. This also should adhere to the raga. This
can<br>
have rhythm but its artists wish to have it or not.<br>
<br>
I think i have explained as elaborate and as simple as possible. please<br>
shoot back if there is any questions.</div>
