<h2>Research Interests</h2>

<p> My primary focus is on computational models. Specifically I am interested in studying computational models using bio-molecules. Recently I am also interested in immunity-based systems. I have also worked and been working in automata theory</p>

<strong>Molecular Computing - Peptide Computing</strong> <br />

With the silicon computers growth in computing speeds almost attaining
a saturation point and with the existence of very hard problems,
nearly unsolvable by the silicon contemporaries, there is a strong
need to look into other technologies to accomplish computing needs in
this modern world. To achieve these goals various alternative
computing models have been proposed -- like, quantum computing, DNA
computing, peptide computing and so on. Peptide computing is the study of using the interactions between peptides and antibodies as a computational model.

<br />
<br />

<strong>Formal Language and Automata Theory</strong> <br />

It is a very old, vast but still a very active area. My work in this area includes study of distributed processing and parallel prcoessing in finite state automata and pushdown automata.

<br />
<br />

<strong>Immunity-Based Systems</strong><br />

Immunity-based systems, inspired by the immune system, are self-maintenance systems. It is a system which can differentiate self and non-self and are quite different from artificial systems which are predominantly event-driven systems. It is a system which watches itself and reorganizes if needed automatically. This study was started well before peptide computing started. My main idea is to study about the ovelaps between the areas, peptide computing and immunity-based systems.<a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer"><img src="http://www.w3.org/Icons/valid-html401" alt="Valid HTML 4.01 Transitional" width="88" height="31" align="right" border="0"></a>
