<h2>Research Interests</h2>
              
<p>My research interests are in various topics. But recently I have been focusing more on Data Analytics, in particular, Text analytics and Cognition and emotion modelling. I have worked on Biocomputing, Formal Language and Automata Theory previously and still continue to work on it but it is in a lower gear for the present moment. </p>

<p> In computational models. Specifically I am interested in studying computational models using bio-molecules. I have also worked and been working in automata theory</p>
              
<strong> Social Media Analytics </strong> <br />   
              
 In Social Media Analytics I mainly concentrate on the qualitative analysis of social media content. In particular I am focusing on the following:
<ol>             
<li>Define social synchrony in the social media in a formal way and study the qualitative nature of social synchrony.</li>
<li>Integrate both structural / network analysis and the qualitative content analysis in social media to make sense of the social media data in a more complete and concrete manner.</li>
<li>To study and predict opinion churning in online social media.</li>
<li>To build a model to do user classification in online social media</li>
<li>Develop a model to build EventNet (similar to WordNet) using social media data for events that is happening in the world.</li>
<li>Plan to build a software tool to gather data from social media seamlessly and more efficiently.</li>
</ol>

<strong>Molecular Computing - Peptide Computing</strong>

With the silicon computers growth in computing speeds almost attaining
a saturation point and with the existence of very hard problems,
nearly unsolvable by the silicon contemporaries, there is a strong
need to look into other technologies to accomplish computing needs in
this modern world. To achieve these goals various alternative
computing models have been proposed -- like, quantum computing, DNA
computing, peptide computing and so on. Peptide computing is the study of using the interactions between peptides and antibodies as a computational model. In this area I am focusing on a formal model for peptide computing called as Peptide computer.
              
              <br />  <br />

<strong>Formal Language and Automata Theory</strong> <br />

My work in this area includes study of distributed processing and parallel prcoessing in finite state automata and pushdown automata.
