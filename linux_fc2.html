<h2>My experiences with Fedora Core 2</h2>

First of all I bought Dell inspiron
1000 for three reasons:<br>

<ul >
  <li>Least prize.</li>
  <li>I do not want to waste money in getting high-end laptop. Instead
I can spend the same money for an even more high-end desktop
system.</li>
  <li>I just use my notebook mostly for LaTeX stuffs and I do not play
multimedia games at all. I play only chess.</li>
</ul>
The configuration is 30GB, 256MB RAM,
2.20Ghz Celeron with CDRW/DVDROM
combo. It comes with slots for wireless network card and three usb
ports which is quite good. I think this is morethan enough for my work.<br>

<p>Notebook came to me with WinXP preinstalled and I just ran it for few
weeks with that. Then after assuring everything is working fine in my
laptop and noting down all the hardwares in my notebook, I decided to
install FC2.&nbsp; FC2 had
only disk druid for partitioning the 30GB. I was trying to put the
Cdrive (i.e., for WinXP) as the first one, but somehow it does not
accept and so it put the / partition which comes as second in my list
as the first one automatically. I know if I do like / parititon as the
first one I may not be able to install windows as it will overwrite the
/ partition. Hence I thought of doing the partition using fdisk. But
fdisk is not there in FC2 so I downloaded RH 7.3 which has fdisk. Then
I partitioned using fdisk like this (here I made a mistake):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cdrive - 10GB - untouched</li>
  <li>/ - 500MB(??) - ext3 - format</li>
  <li>/swap - 600MB - ext3 - format</li>
  <li>extended ones:
  <ul>
    <li>&nbsp;/Ddrive - 5GB - FAT - format</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>&nbsp;/home - 5GB - ext3 - format</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>&nbsp;/usr - 8GB - ext3 - format</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>
<p>After the partitioning I switched off
the system to continue installation of WinXP. After installing WinXP I
started FC2 installation. The first CD started but it could not go into
the graphics mode of installation so I went into the text mode. I had
checked the media and all the four CDs were fine. So I started the
installation selecting all packages but it hung 2/3 times at the same
point when installing some fonts for swedish/something I do not remeber
well. So then I chose not to select all bit only the gnome.
Installation went off fine. But when it rebooted it just went into
WinXP; it did not show grub loader at all. I thought there was a
serious mistake that I did not install grub in MBR. Went to the forum
and searched for a solution got this very comprehensive <a
 href="http://forums.fedoraforum.org/showthread.php?t=975">thread</a> .
This solved my grub problem. Now I can boot into WinXP and FC2; but FC2
would not boot into Xwindows since it has not detected my&nbsp; video
card correctly. After questioning the forum I got the following
solution:</p>
My /etc/X11/xorg.conf was having these lines before,<br>
<br>
Section "Device"<br>
Identifier "Videocard0"<br>
Driver "sis"<br>
Vendorname "Videocard Vendor"<br>
Boardname "SiS 650"<br>
EndSection<br>
<br>
Seemed like it has detected my videocard correctly; but forum adviced
me to change the line Driver "sis" as Driver "vesa"; Oh my goodness!
Xwindows works fine. I could not believe it took me one week to sort
out this problem :) so the above lines now looked like this,<br>
<br>
Section "Device"<br>
Identifier "Videocard0"<br>
Driver "vesa"<br>
Vendorname "Videocard Vendor"<br>
Boardname "SiS 650"<br>
EndSection<br>
<br>
Success/failure list:<br>

<ul>
  <li>Audio card working</li>
  <li>Video card not detected properly but after small change as above
now it is fine</li>
  <li>Touchpad working fine</li>
  <li>My printer deskjet 932c was not working eventhough it had the
proper driver "hcijfs"</li>
  <li>Digital cam Sony DSC-W1 not able to import files to notebook</li>
  <li>Xfig was not installed so had to install if manually</li>
  <li>Azureus 2.3.0.4 worked fine after I isntalled JRE</li>
  <li>Firefox worked good</li>
  <li>xmms with mp3 plugin was cool</li>
  <li>gmplayer installed through source was working fine but the plugin
for firefox was not working.</li>
  <li>gaim works only for yahoo not for msn and gtalk, eventough I had
the latest version of gaim.</li>
  <li>Installed Nerolinux for writing CDs. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Tried to install K3B withour KDE but could not succeed for some
reasons. But I know it can be done without KDE.</li>
  <li>Standby/suspend not working<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>When I partitioned I made a serious
mistake of allocating only 500MB to /. So sometimes later when I did
yum update it abrutly ended saying my / partition is full. Then I could
not login into Xwindows at all as some files when you login has to be
written in / partition for which there is no space. So I got into
serious problem but sorted it out by making to write those files in
/usr partition where I had some space. So its always better to allocate
more space for / and /usr.</p>

<p>I was happy with the overall performance of FC2 although some of my
external hardwares like printer and digital camera not working. I was
using this for 1.25 years without any big problems; but suddenly my HDD
gave some peculiar problems and it went really bad. So had to replace
it and by that time FC4 was out so thought of installing the latest
verion of FC.&nbsp; Now come to my FC4 experience!</p><br>
