<strong>Chess</strong>
<br>

<p>Chess is the game I like most. It
is astounding to me and obviously to many to see how complicated the
chess can be. My
favourite chess players are Bobby, Kapsy and Vishy: Bobby for his
unconventional and very attacking style, Kaspy for his consistent
showing at the highest level for many years and Vishy for his speed and
calculated approach.&nbsp;</p> 

<p>I play online chess regularly in FICS and I have a reasonable rating
there. Some of the games (you can play when you open the file in the
browser) which I played in FICS are
listed below just for entertainment sake. I have edited the pgn file so
as to hide the opponent names. I mostly play Kings gambit with white
and Sicilian with black.</p>

<a href="Best_games/games/game_1_1.html">Game 1</a>: I play white here.
This game shows how
attacking can be the kings gambit even if white loses some materials.
It also depicts the importance of developing your pieces as early as
possible. Alas my opponent forfeits on time deliberately after coming
into this losing position :)

<br><br>

<a href="Best_games/games/game_2_1.html">Game 2</a>: White is mine.
This is a very
entertaining game.

<br><br>

<a href="Best_games/games/game_3_1.html">Game 3</a>: Again I play
white. This game enters
into an entertaining stage after I sacrifice two pawns. Sacrificing
does not end there :), again I do the same with a rook and a knight for
the ultimate attack on the black king.<br>
<br>
I am a great fan of Vishy Anand. I have two games of his just see how
he plays!! awesome....amazing games especially the game with Radjabov.<br>
<br>
<a href="Anand_games/games/Anand-Kasparov1991_1.html">Game 1</a>:
Anand-Kasparov 1991, perhaps the first time Anand winning against
Kasparov. See his knight manoveur at the 10th move Ndb5!! this
ultimately captures the black queen. Great game!<br>
<br>
<a href="Anand_games/games/Radjabov-Anand_1.html">Game 2</a>
Radjabov-Anand 2002. Amazing game by Anand. Just watch his queen
sacrifice at the 26th move. Only a genius like Anand can play these
moves.....seeing the back rank of white very weak he sacrifices his
queen and gets his 2 rooks to the whites back rank and threatens to
mate him; at the same time he has his pawn also "to be queened" square.
Awesome chess.....easily the best game of Anand in my opinion.<br>
<br>
I will be including more games soon, Bye!<br>
