<h2> My experiences with Fedora Core 4</h2>

<p>Previously I was using FC2 with WinXP
in my notebook for almost 1.25
years. For some reason my harddisk went bad and I had to replace it
with a new harddisk. But I could not find the same 30GB HDD so I got
40GB HDD. I had FC3 with me but since FC4 was already out I
thought I would go for FC4 instead of FC3. After replacing my harddisk
I was just running WinXP for a week. I was having only one partition on
my HDD. I can do the partition magic to divide the partition for WinXP
and free the partition for Linux; but since I had no useful datas
sitting on my HDD I decide to do complete installations for both. First
I put the WinXP CD for installation I created 2 paritions one 8GB and
other 32GB I left untouched. Installed WinXP in the 8GB parititon which
became my C directory. My D directory is my CD drive. Then I put the
FC4 CD 1 and booted it through the CDROM. Before getting into
installation I tried testing the media first time I got the message
media not good for installation as it is corrupted; I was quite
surprised; then again I checked this time I got the message failed and
asked me to clean the media for dust. I cleaned my media with a small
soft cloth and went into the installation instead of again testing :).
The installation went into graphics mode without any problem unlike the
FC2 and&nbsp; with disk druid I did the custom partitioning like this;</p>

1) First partition - C directory - NTFS - 8GB - untouched <br>
<br>
2) Second partition - / directory - ext3 - 5GB - format<br>
<br>
3) Third partition - FAT - 8GB - format<br>
<br>
4) Extended ones - a) Swap - 1.2GB - format<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; b)
Home - ext3 - 5GB - format<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; c)
/usr - ext3 - remaining - format<br>

<p>Chose the packages for my use and there it started my installation. It
went fine and it seemed to have recognized all my hardwares. When I got
it installed I logged in and saw the resolution is not as I wanted; the
resolution fo my laptop is 1024x768 but my Xconfig file was having only
800x600 and an even lesser one. So I opened the display preperties as
root and saw my monitor was put as unknown. I chose the Dell LCD
1024x768 which was there in the list and logged in again. Now my
resolution was perfect :)</p>

Success list:

<ul>
  <li>Sound card works</li>
  <li>Video works fine after little tweak as said above</li>
  <li>Touch pad....oops...tooo sensitive...looked into forums and know
how to deal with it...but I am used to it now :)</li>
  <li>Usb all ports works fine, ethernet works.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Deskjet 932c printer recognized without any fuss, unlike the FC2
version :)</li>
  <li>I can work with my digital camera DSC-W1 to import
pictures....great....</li>
  <li>K3B works really fine so I can write (V)CD/DVD. For VCD I needed
to install vcdimager as an extra package. I was running Nerolinux in
FC2 but K3B is awesome.<br>
  </li>
  <li>xmms (my favorite player) installed with mp3 plugins. But it was
stopping when playing songs so I did the following in xmms goto options
-&gt; preferences -&gt; output plugin -&gt; configure -&gt; advanced
settings and uncheck the Mmap mode. Now it is working perfectly</li>
  <li>For the following things to work I referred this <a
 href="http://stanton-finley.net/fedora_core_4_installation_notes.html">page</a>
. It gives a step by step approach to install some useful softwares and
get it configured correctly for your system.
  <ul>
    <li>firefox (my favorite browser)</li>
    <li>mplayer</li>
    <li>bittorrent (azureus is the best one but it is not working in my
notebook. But I was using azureus in FC2)</li>
  </ul> </li>
  <li>Installed realplayer after installing the required lib files
present in&nbsp; libcdio-0.76-1.fc4.i386.rpm.</li>
  <li>Installed JRE without any problem. For mozilla plugin for java I
followed this <a href="http://home.gagme.com/greg/linux/fc4-tips.php">page</a>.
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Acrobat reader installed and works fine.</li>
  <li>Gaim works for yahoo, msn and gtalk. So I and others can be
online in all at the same time in the same window. This is really
cool.&nbsp; In FC2 only yahoo was working.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
Untried/Failures

<ul>
  <li>Azureus not working giving lots of run-time errors eventhough I
have installed JRE. I do not know why. But I do not want this one as it
captures most of my RAM.</li>
  <li>Modem untried since I have Hi-speed network</li>
  <li>Wireless not tried. Planning to try it soon...</li>
  <li>Sound recording has some problems I am trying to sort it out. Mic
is working but when I record and play no sound comes out. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Suspend/standby modes not working (if anyone knows how to do this
please contact me. I would be really happy.)<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>In a nutshell we can see the list
above there is more success than failures, I am quite satisified with
this version.&nbsp; Surprisingly even KDE works fast enough with this
256mb RAM notebook. Although I am a gnome fan I am using KDE now for a
change :)</p>
Bye! Wish you happy time with Fedora!<br>
